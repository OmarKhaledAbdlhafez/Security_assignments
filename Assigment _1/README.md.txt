this a roject for encryption and decryption using shift, affine, and
vigenere ciphers.
The should be callable from command line as follows:
◦ First argument is the cipher type [“shift”,”affine”,”vigenere”].
◦ Second argument is the operation type [“enc”, “dec”].
◦ The Third argument is the input file.
◦ The fourth argument is the output file.
◦ The last argument is the the list of encryption keys required for the cipher.
note that if the cipher use only one key pls pass the second as 0 
u can use upper or lower case it will work 
the spaces don't affect
